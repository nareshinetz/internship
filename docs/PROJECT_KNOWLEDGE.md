the few files involved in a task.

## Product and stack

Inetz is a training/internship platform with public program and marketing pages,
student enrollment/payment management and an admin back office.

- Next.js 16 App Router, React 19, strict TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS 4; shared UI primitives in `src/components/ui`
- NextAuth 4 with credentials and Google providers; JWT sessions
- MongoDB through Mongoose
- Razorpay payments, SMTP receipt email, Cloudinary blog media
- Docker deployment to AWS ECR/ECS from `.github/workflows/aws.yml`

The root layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`) composes metadata/JSON-LD, providers,
theme, navbar, page content, footer, WhatsApp control, and toast rendering.
Global styling is in `src/app/globals.css`; `src/app/providers.tsx` owns global
client providers.

## Identity and authorization

The shared identity/enrollment design is documented in
`docs/STUDENT_ENROLLMENT_ARCHITECTURE.md`. The internship application now uses
the target `User`, `Enrollment`, and `RazorpayOrder` contracts in its active
flows, but production data has not been migrated and the legacy `Student`
model remains available as the migration source. Coordinate the identical
schemas and indexes with the course application before deployment or index
creation against the shared database.

Primary files:

- `src/lib/authOptions.ts`: NextAuth providers, sign-in rules, JWT/session role
  propagation, and `/login` configuration.
- `src/proxy.ts`: redirects unauthenticated users and prevents cross-role access
  to student, admin, dashboard, and onboarding pages.
- `src/lib/api-auth.ts`: `requireRole(...roles)` for server/API authorization.
- `src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts`: student account registration.
- `src/app/api/auth/me/route.ts`: current account plus linked student data.
- `src/app/api/student/link-phone/route.ts`: links an authenticated account to
  an enrollment where needed.

Roles are `student` and `admin`. Google sign-in creates student accounts. Page
gating is convenience, not the security boundary: protected route handlers
must independently call `requireRole` before reading input or mutating data.

## Core data ownership

- `User`: login identity, provider, role, and phone fields.
- `src/lib/student-id.ts`: assigns one permanent User.studentId on first paid
  online enrollment or admin enrollment; registration alone has no ID.
- `Enrollment`: service ownership, domain/duration, billing total, embedded
  installments, derived collection/balance/status, and certificate state.
- `Student`: preserved legacy migration source; active flows do not write it.
- `Program`: public catalog content, official price, syllabus, projects, reviews.
- `RazorpayOrder`: local order lock and audit trail (`creating`, `created`,
  `processed`, `expired`, `failed`), with unique lock/order/payment IDs.
- `Blog`: editorial content and Cloudinary-backed media references.
- `Notification`: compact admin event history with a 90-day TTL, read state,
  and deduplication key.

Important relationships are application-level rather than a single aggregate:
`User._id` identifies the account and `Enrollment.userId` owns each enrollment.
Payment work must resolve the authenticated account to the exact enrollment,
not accept identity, price, or ownership supplied by the client.

## Razorpay payment flow

```text
Student dashboard
  -> POST /api/apply
     -> authenticate student
     -> load official Program price and matching Student enrollment
     -> validate requested installment <= current balance
     -> acquire one active RazorpayOrder lock
     -> create Razorpay order and store its ID
  -> Razorpay Checkout
     -> POST /api/verify (browser signature confirmation)
        OR POST /api/razorpay/webhook (provider callback)
     -> recordRazorpayPayment(orderId, paymentId)
        -> fetch authoritative Razorpay order/payment
        -> require captured payment, INR, matching IDs and amount
        -> in one transaction, claim RazorpayOrder and append Enrollment installment
        -> assign User.studentId if absent
        -> email receipt
```

Key files:

- `src/components/RazorpayCheckout.tsx`: browser checkout launcher only.
- `src/app/api/apply/route.ts`: authenticated order creation, rate limit,
  enrollment resolution, balance ceiling, and active-order lock.
- `src/app/api/verify/route.ts`: verifies the checkout HMAC using the stored
  order ID, then delegates recording.
- `src/app/api/razorpay/webhook/route.ts`: verifies raw-body webhook HMAC and
  handles captured payments, then delegates recording.
- `src/lib/record-razorpay-payment.ts`: the single idempotent payment recorder.
- `src/lib/payment-receipt-email.ts`: SMTP receipt delivery.
- `src/models/RazorpayOrder.ts`: order state and uniqueness guarantees.
- `src/app/student/dashboard/components/CoursesTab.tsx`: balance/payment UI.
- `src/app/student/dashboard/components/TransactionsTab.tsx`: payment history
  and PDF receipt download using the established admin receipt format.
- `src/app/api/payments/route.ts` and `src/components/PaymentModel.tsx`: admin
  manual payment recording; keep its authorization and billing invariants.

The database row is retained after completion as an audit/idempotency record;
its active lock is released and status becomes `processed`. Never delete it as
part of normal success. Browser verification and webhook share the recorder;
the tracked-order claim and Enrollment installment save commit in one MongoDB
transaction, so a concurrent confirmation retries and sees the processed order.

Razorpay webhook configuration is an external operational step. Point it at
`/api/razorpay/webhook`, subscribe to `payment.captured`, and configure the same
secret as `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.

## Student dashboard

`src/app/student/dashboard/page.tsx` owns the three tabs and loads session-linked
data from `/api/auth/me`:

- `ProfileTab`: editable identity/enrollment details
- `CoursesTab`: enrolled track, fee summary, payment status, installment payment
- `TransactionsTab`: receipts and PDF downloads
- `PhoneLinkModal`: resolves an account missing its enrollment phone link

Applications, interviews, progress bars, resume uploads, GitHub, and LinkedIn
fields are intentionally absent from this UI. The dashboard visual language is
compact, professional, light, and blue-accented.

## Other feature entry points

- Programs: `src/app/programs`, `src/components/programs`,
  `/api/programs`, `/api/catalog`, `Program` model.
- Admin: `src/app/admin/page.tsx`; tracks, students, transactions, journals;
  `/api/tracks`, `/api/students`, `/api/payments`, `/api/blogs`.
- Admin notifications: registrations, enrollments, and successful payments are
  persisted in `Notification`; `/api/admin/notifications` provides paginated
  history/read state and `/stream` provides single-instance EC2 SSE updates.
- Blogs: `src/app/blog`, admin journals, `/api/blogs`, Cloudinary configuration.
- Leads: `/api/send-lead` sends to a Google Sheet, email, and WhatsApp when
  configured.
- Certificates: `/certificate` and `/api/certificate/data`.
- Syllabus tools: `/api/process-syllabus` uses Gemini; `/api/download-pdf`
  serves generated/static PDFs.

## Environment contract

Names only; values belong in deployment secrets/local ignored environment files.

- Core: `MONGODB_URI`, `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, `NEXTAUTH_URL`
- Google login: `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`
- Razorpay: `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID`, `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET`,
  `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- Mail: `EMAIL_USER`/`EMAIL_PASS` or `SMTP_USER`/`SMTP_PASS`, plus optional
  `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`
- Media/AI: `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`,
  `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- Leads: `GOOGLE_SHEET_WEBAPP_URL`, `WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN`,
  `WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID`, `RECIPIENT_PHONE_NUMBER`

`next.config.ts` owns production security headers/CSP and the external origins
required by Razorpay and remote images. Recheck CSP whenever adding an external
browser resource.

## Change routing and validation

- Auth/roles: inspect `authOptions.ts`, `proxy.ts`, `api-auth.ts`, then the exact
  route/page. Run `npm run test:auth` and lint.
- Payment changes: inspect the full payment flow above. Test order creation,
  partial payment, duplicate verify/webhook delivery, balance ceiling, receipt,
  and authorization; then lint/build.
- Schema changes: inspect every writer and reader of the model, indexes, existing
  production data compatibility, and whether a migration is required.
- Shared student cutover: while both applications are write-frozen, run
  `migration:dry-run`, install reviewed indexes with `migration:indexes`, apply
  that exact reviewed plan with `migration:apply`, and confirm it with
  `migration:verify`. Index and apply commands require an explicit `--apply`.
- UI changes: reuse the nearest feature component and `src/components/ui`; check
  mobile and desktop layouts plus loading/error/empty states.
- API changes: test unauthenticated, wrong-role, invalid-input, success, and
  duplicate/retry behavior as applicable.

Do not update this file for ordinary component edits or bug fixes. Update it
when a file takes ownership of a concern, a critical flow changes, an invariant
is added/removed, or deployment configuration gains a required external step.
